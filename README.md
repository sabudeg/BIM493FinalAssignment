Xamarin.Nuget packages works nicely.
Firebase Authentication works completely. User needs to sign up to our database for using the platform.
There is no reading from database because of no information on xamarin.android documents. For database operations, we convert all the methods from native android language into xamarin android. Thus, firebase database works for only database save operations. We have used a mock data List to retrieve post informations.
